In Summary, the business focuses on a particular product type and region each month. There was only a change in the product type in August when the business initially sold shoes in 2023 but later changed to selling Hats in 2024.  
  

## SQL (STANDARD QUERY LANGUAGE)
---
It is used for querying, storing and managing data in a database. The data that had already been cleaned up from Excel was imported.
The following queries were derived in the analysis:

**Insights Derived**:
1. Total sales for each Product Category:

~~~ SQL
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset]
GROUP BY Product
order by TotalSales desc
~~~

2. Find the number of sales transactions in each region:

~~~ SQL
SELECT Region, count(quantity * UnitPrice) AS SalesCount
from [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset]
group by region
~~~

3. Find the highest-selling product by total sales value:
   
~~~ SQL
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset]
GROUP BY Product
order by 2 desc
~~~

4. Calculate total revenue per product:

~~~ SQL
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset]
GROUP BY Product
~~~

5. calculate monthly sales totals for the current year:

~~~ SQL
SELECT 
    MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS MonthlySales
FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset]
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = YEAR(GETDATE())
GROUP BY  MONTH(OrderDate)
ORDER BY Month;
~~~

6. Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount:

~~~ SQL
SELECT Top 5 Customer_Id, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalPurchase
FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset]
GROUP BY Customer_Id
ORDER BY TotalPurchase DESC
~~~

7. Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region:

~~~ SQL
SELECT Region, sum(Quantity * UnitPrice) as TotalSales,
(SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) * 100.00 / (SELECT SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) 
from [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset] as PercentageOfTotalSales
WHERE  PercentageOfTotalSales
~~~

8. Identify products with no sales in the last quarter:

~~~ SQL
SELECT Product
FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset]
WHERE Product NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT Product
        FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset]
        WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(QUARTER, -1, GETDATE())
    );
~~~


## POWER BI
A data Visualization and business intelligence tool for converting data from different sources to interactive dashboards. The following are required to be presented on the visualization tool:
1. Create a dashboard that visualises the Excel and SQL insights.
2. The dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.

### INSIGHTS DRIVEN:

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of a businessâ€™s sales data over the past two years, focusing on 9,921 customers and tracking product sales across various regions. Initially, the dataset comprised 50,001 rows and 7 columns, covering customer details, product types, regions, order dates, quantity, and unit price. After removing duplicates, the data was refined to 9,921 unique records, with an additional column created to calculate total sales revenue.

From this data, we can see that the business achieved total revenue of 2,101,090, with shoes emerging as the highest-selling product category. Given its consistent demand across multiple regions, this product alone presents a significant growth opportunity. It would be strategically advantageous for the business to continue prioritizing shoes, as well as expanding their sales into the North region, where they are not currently available.

Breaking down product performance by region reveals that each area has distinct product preferences. In the North, the primary items sold were shirts, hats, and jackets. Meanwhile, the South region showed strong sales for gloves, shoes, and socks, and the East saw demand for jackets, hats, shirts, and shoes. In the West, socks, shoes, hats, and gloves were top sellers. Additionally, regional sales insights show that the combined sales value for shoes across the South, East, and West reached 613,380, making it a dominant product in these regions. Hats brought in 316,195 in the East, West, and North, while shirts reached 485,600 across the North and East. Socks totalled 180,785 in the West and South, and jackets earned 208,230 in the North and East. Gloves contributed 296,900 to the South and West.

An analysis of seasonal trends indicates that February was the peak sales month in both years, while April had the lowest sales volume in the previous year, and July in the current year saw a similar low. Year-over-year comparisons show that, although the business sold a greater quantity of products last year, sales revenue has increased in the present year. As of August 2024, the total revenue stands at 29,780, a promising figure compared to last yearâ€™s close at 38,681.

Visualizations were key to highlighting these findings: column charts effectively represented average and total revenue by product, bar charts illustrated monthly sales trends, and regional performance was presented using pie and doughnut charts for a clear view of revenue and sales distribution. A table outlined product quantities by region, multi-row cards highlighted the top-selling products, and cards summarized key figures, making the data accessible and actionable.

In conclusion, the South region and shoes represent strategic priorities for the business. Expanding shoe sales into the North could further drive growth, capitalizing on this high-performing product across all regions. Additionally, introducing socks to the East region, where shoes are already thriving, may uncover new sales opportunities.
