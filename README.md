### Project Title: Sales Data

### Project Overview
This is an analysis and visualization of sales data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, to uncover trends for strategic decision-making. This project, part of my GitHub portfolio, showcases my proficiency in data storytelling and highlights my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights with advanced tools confidently.

### Data Source
Our facilitator provided this dataset

### Dataset Description
This dataset contains various details of products sold in a store in a different geographical area. These types of datasets are studied to find out the patterns in the selling structure, profit earned from them, and order history. This data contains 9921 rows and 7 columns, while a missing key column was added in the cleaning process, making it a total of 8 columns.


### Key Features:
**OrderID**: A unique identifier for each customer's order
**CustomerID**: Each customer's unique ID
**Product**: The name of the product ordered
**Region**: The region in which the order was placed
**OrderDate**: The date the product was ordered
**Quantity**: The quantity of the product ordered
**UnitPrice**: The unit price for each product
**Revenue**: The revenue derived from the product sold


### Data Tools
* Microsoft Excel, for:
  > Data cleaning;
  > Data Analysis and Summarization.
* SQL [Structured Query Language] for Querying data
* Power BI for Data Visualization
* GitHub for Portfolio building


### Microsoft Excel
Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet tool for data organization (cleaning and preparation), analysis, and visualization. It offers features like formulas, pivot tables, and charts, which enable users to manage and interpret data.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Processing the raw data to ensure it is ready for analysis. Steps taken:
> Removing Duplicates: The initial rows of the data were 50001, but after removing duplicates, 9921 rows were left. No missing values were found; 
> Adding filters;
> Adding conditional formatting


### Exploratory Data Analysis
The following insights will be drawn:
* Which region has the highest sales?
* What product was sold the most?
* What month did they have the highest sales?
* What quantity of product was sold in each month of the year?
* What is the total number of products sold in the year?
* What is the total revenue of products sold in each region?
* Which region is best for business?
* Which product should the business focus more on?
